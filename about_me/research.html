                        Nowadays, many galaxy surveys provide us tremendous

                        time. Building their statistical connection is critical
                        for us to understand the galaxy evolution process.

                        <strong>What is proto-cluster?</strong><br />
                        Proto-cluster is the collection of galaxies, halos and
                        other material at high redshift that will enter in a
                        common massive dark matter halos. Normally, we require
                        the descendant halo mass above 10^14 solar mass.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Why is proto-cluster important?</strong><br />
                        There are two motivations:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                We want to connect galaxies across different
                                redshift to infer their evolution along with
                                cosmic time. Since proto-clusters are
                                progenitors of galaxy clusters in local
                                Universe, their detection can help us to build
                                the connection.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Galaxy observation in local Universe show
                                dictinct properties for galaxies in field and
                                cluster environments. Thus, we need to
                                specifically study the progenitors of local
                                galaxy clusters.

                        <strong>How to find proto-clusters?</strong><br />
                        There are many detection method proposed, each with
                        different tracer. In this project, we use the dark
                        matter halos constructed from the galaxy group findr to
                        identify proto-clusters.

                        Galay group is a collection of galaxies that are sharing
                        a common dark matter halo.

                        <strong>Why do we want to study galaxy group?</strong
                        ><br />
                        In LCDM paradigm, galaxies are formed and evolved in
                        dark matter halos, so their properties are tightly
                        correlated. Thus, by identifying galaxy groups in survey
                        data, we can directly build the connection between their
                        properties.

                            How to find galaxy groups? </strong
                        ><br />
                        Various group finding algorithms were proposed in the
                        literature, and one of the most common one is called
                        Friend-of-Friend (FoF) method. In this project, we
                        succefully identify the galaxy groups using FoF method.
