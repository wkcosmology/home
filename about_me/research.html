                        Galaxies are formed and evolve in dark matter halos, so
                        it is critical to understand their relation before we
                        can understand the galaxy formation and evolution.<br />

                        Nowadays, many galaxy surveys provide us tremendous
                        observational data at different redshifts, or cosmic
                        time. Building their statistical connection is critical
                        for us to understand the galaxy evolution process.

                        Unlike experimental physics, we cannot directly observe
                        the evolution of astronomical objects, or manipulate
                        them. Thus, the only way to infer the underlying physics
                        is analysing the data using statistical tools.

                Finding proto-clusters to trace galaxy evolution

                    <li>
                        <strong>What is proto-cluster?</strong><br />
                        Proto-cluster is the collection of galaxies, halos and
                        other material at high redshift that will enter in a
                        common massive dark matter halos. Normally, we require
                        the descendant halo mass above 10^14 solar mass.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Why is proto-cluster important?</strong><br />
                        There are two motivations:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                We want to connect galaxies across different
                                redshift to infer their evolution along with
                                cosmic time. Since proto-clusters are
                                progenitors of galaxy clusters in local
                                Universe, their detection can help us to build
                                the connection.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Galaxy observation in local Universe show
                                dictinct properties for galaxies in field and
                                cluster environments. Thus, we need to
                                specifically study the progenitors of local
                                galaxy clusters.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How to find proto-clusters?</strong><br />
                        There are many detection method proposed, each with
                        different tracer. In this project, we use the dark
                        matter halos constructed from the galaxy group findr to
                        identify proto-clusters.
